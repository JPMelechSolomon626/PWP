    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
        Laser light flickered all over him as if he were a packet of biscuits at a supermarket check-out. Honestly, Arthur, you humans only use ten percent of your brains, and you fill that fraction with tea-related information. “I suddenly feel as though I should be running away.” On the way back they sang a number of tuneful and reflective songs on the subjects of peace, justice, morality, culture, sport, family life and the obliteration of all other life forms. You live and learn. At any rate, you live. At night, it was at its most spectacular, floodlit by the teams of television crews who covered it continuously as it continuously did nothing. Anything that, in happening, causes itself to happen again, happens again. Isn’t it enough to see that a garden is beautiful without having to believe that there are fairies at the bottom of it too? He was clearly a man of many qualities, even if they were mostly bad ones.
