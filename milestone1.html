He also uses his site to feature members of his facilities both in the Israel,the US, Australia, the United Kingdom and Canada to generate interest in their plight in the hopes of seeing them fostered and adopted. He also uses his site as a means of encrypted communication between his organization and rescuers.  He would also like to utilize his site as an internal secure site communication system, similar to reddit, where fosterlings can keep in touch with rescuers, parents and others for the purpose of eventual reunification between fosterlings and living relatives.
